      "This notebook shows how to manage text encodings with Python. It is mostly based in the [Unicode HOWTO](http://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode), and the [codecs](http://docs.python.org/2/library/codecs.html) library module from the Python documentation. I have decided to start with these notes because handling encodings seems a pretty difficult task if you do not understand what Unicode is and how it works and how the are different ways of encode the same string.

      "Characters are the smallest units of a text. Usually, we think about letters, but everything that can have its own glyph (i.e., drawing), such as a number, a math symbol or a greek letter, is a character. A _character table_ is a list of numerical values for a certain list of characters. The most ancient character table is the well known ASCII table. ASCI defined numeric codes for 128 characters (from 0 to 127), mostly including English letters and numbers, but not (for example) accented characters. ASCII characters have an important feature: they use only 7 bits, so they can be always represented by a byte. In fact, another common encoding, Latin-1 (or ISO-8859-1), uses 8 bits, encoding 256 characters using just a byte. The first 128 characters of Latin-1 are the same as characters of ASCII.  Python 2 strings are ASCII strings"

You have no option: assign them a new code, and use more than one byte to represent it.

      "This is a very common error. You should really be sure that you understand what is happening. In the first example, we simply pass a 8-bit string, and Python creates a unicode value, assuming ascii. In the second, we specify the Euro sign using hexa values, and tell Python that the 8-bit ascii string we passed is actually encoding sometingh using utf-8. In the third case, Python tries to create the Unicode character, but when he comes to character '\\xe2' (that is, a decimal value of 226), discover that it is an invalid ascii value, and fails. This is *completely independent* if the encoding you are using for your source file. "

      "- Python 3.0 uses the concepts of text and (binary) data instead of Unicode strings and 8-bit strings. All text is Unicode; however encoded Unicode is represented as binary data. The type used to hold text is str, the type used to hold data is bytes. The biggest difference with the 2.x situation is that any attempt to mix text and data in Python 3.0 raises TypeError, whereas if you were to mix Unicode and 8-bit strings in Python 2.x, it would work if the 8-bit string happened to contain only 7-bit (ASCII) bytes, but you would get UnicodeDecodeError if it contained non-ASCII values. This value-specific behavior has caused numerous sad faces over the years.\n",
      "- As a consequence of this change in philosophy, pretty much all code that uses Unicode, encodings or binary data most likely has to change. The change is for the better, as in the 2.x world there were numerous bugs having to do with mixing encoded and unencoded text. To be prepared in Python 2.x, start using unicode for all unencoded text, and str for binary or encoded data only. Then the 2to3 tool will do most of the work for you.\n",
      "- You can no longer use u\"...\" literals for Unicode text. However, you must use b\"...\" literals for binary data.\n",
      "- All backslashes in raw string literals are interpreted literally. This means that '\\U' and '\\u' escapes in raw strings are not treated specially. For example, r'\\u20ac' is a string of 6 characters in Python 3.0, whereas in 2.6, ur'\\u20ac' was the single \u201ceuro\u201d character. (Of course, this change only affects raw string literals; the euro character is '\\u20ac' in Python 3.0.)\n",
      "- Files opened as text files (still the default mode for open()) always use an encoding to map between strings (in memory) and bytes (on disk). Binary files (opened with a b in the mode argument) always use bytes in memory. This means that if a file is opened using an incorrect mode or encoding, I/O will likely fail loudly, instead of silently producing incorrect data. It also means that even Unix users will have to specify the correct mode (text or binary) when opening a file. There is a platform-dependent default encoding, which on Unixy platforms can be set with the LANG environment variable (and sometimes also with some other platform-specific locale-related environment variables). In many cases, but not all, the system default is UTF-8; you should never count on this default. Any application reading or writing more than pure ASCII text should probably have a way to override the encoding. There is no longer any need for using the encoding-aware streams in the codecs module.\n",
